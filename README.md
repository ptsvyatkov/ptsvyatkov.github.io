### Tourjourney project
Final semester **thesis project** of my Bachelor studies in 2022/2023. (B.Sc. in Computer Science, International Media and Computing)

The topic of my thesis was **"Conception, implementation and evaluation of the internationalisation of a web application"** and the following research question was posed: "How does internationalization affect the usability of web application systems?"

The goal of the project was the conception and development of an interactive apartment booking web application localized for the Bulgarian and German speaking region in order to evaluate if there are differences in the user interaction and web preferences regarding both cultures. 

Before beginning with the development, interviews with experts on the topic were conducted, from which functional and non-functional requirements were outlined. According to these a prototype was created and heuristically evaluated by German and Bulgarian users.

The Tourjourney applicatiion is created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. <br> React-i18next was utilized in order to internationalize the web application for German and Bulgarian as well as English as a fallback language.
